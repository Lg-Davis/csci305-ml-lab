Lab Questions
=======================
1. val it = [,2,5,2,6,10] : int list

2. The function f takes a given list of values, adds one to each element in the list
   and returns the new edited list.

For questions 3 and 4, I am under the assumption that you are referring to everything
before each comment (* a *) and (* b *)

3. The line that come before (* a *) defines a function f that takes in a list [] and
   returns a list []

4. The line before the comment (* b *) states that for each element in the list that
   is passed into f should have 1 added to it and then retuned to the list.

5. test.sml:13.1-13.33 Error: operator and operand don't agree [tycon mismatch]
    operator domain: ''Z * ''Z set
    operand:          string
    in expression: isMember "one"

6. My isMember function uses tail recursion

8. A function that returns the value of its recursive call is said to be tail
   recursive. The advantage is that a tail recursive function can be compiled into
   a for loop. No computation happens after the recursive call. Thus, no variables
   are referenced after recursive call.
